Rainbow Chart VR
=========================

This is a work-in-progress


ToDo
------------

Currently this solution is not very useful.
Here are some things I need to do to correct that:
- Make bar height and actual data value accurate
- Floor plane should vary in size dynamically according to number of bars


The Project
------------

All the things:
- A-frame (JavaScript VR framework (wrapper for webVR DOM elements))
- D3js (JavaScript framework for data visualization)
- Various image assets for bl.ocks.org


Notes
-------------

I tried using Mirror.js to create a mirrored floor plane.  So far it has failed and I removed the code.

You may have noticed that the bar heights seem inversely proportional to the actual values...  haven't looked into that bug yet, but it's high on my priority list
