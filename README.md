Rainbow Chart VR
=========================

This is a work-in-progress


ToDo
------------

Currently this solution is not very useful.
Here are some things I need to do to correct that:
- Floor plane should vary in size dynamically according to number of bars
- Mouseover needs to be updated to cursor-over via A-Frame so that tooltips can be seen when in VR


The Project
------------

All the things:
- A-frame (JavaScript VR framework (wrapper for webVR DOM elements))
- D3js (JavaScript framework for data visualization)
- Various image assets for bl.ocks.org


Notes
-------------

I tried using Mirror.js to create a mirrored floor plane.  So far it has failed and I removed the code.
